## 📜 Overview
This toolkit provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for advanced web scraping techniques, focusing on the use of Selenium for dynamic web page interactions and bypassing CAPTCHAs, complemented by multithreading to improve performance.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Features

### Bypassing CAPTCHA with Selenium
This project utilizes Selenium, a powerful tool for automating web browsers, to interact with web pages dynamically. Selenium's capabilities allow us to mimic human behavior more closely than simple HTTP requests or cURL commands. This approach is particularly effective in environments where CAPTCHA challenges are present, as many CAPTCHAs are designed to thwart non-browser-based access attempts. By leveraging Selenium, we can navigate these challenges more successfully, providing access to data on sites protected by CAPTCHA.

### Speeding Up Selenium with Multithreading
While Selenium is powerful, it's also known for being slower than direct HTTP requests due to the overhead of browser automation. To mitigate this, the project implements Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for multithreading, allowing multiple instances of Selenium to run in parallel. This significantly reduces the time required to scrape large volumes of data by making concurrent requests, thus overcoming one of Selenium's primary limitations without sacrificing its ability to interact dynamically with web pages.

## 📈 Usage
To get started, run the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
```
